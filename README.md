Here a data modeling for fitness database example!!


![Fitness-Data Modeling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7ed0358-26f2-4ecc-8db6-a8c0e697c141)

This data model seems designed for a fitness or exercise tracking app. Basically, itâ€™s a system that allows users to track their exercise, nutrition, and water consumption habits.

The data model includes:

1) A central UserInformation table. This table contains user information (name, surname, password, email, country, date of birth, height, weight, etc.).
2) The user is associated with a specific Gender, Activity Level, and Goal.
3) Users can create a Workout record. Each workout is associated with a specific exercise and body part.
4) The Exercise table shows each exercise with a difficulty level and name.
5) The ExerciseBody table is a relationship table that shows how much each exercise affects each body part.
6) Users can track their daily water consumption and nutrition goals with the WaterTracker and NutritionData tables.
7) This data model provides a comprehensive system that allows users to set fitness goals, follow their exercise programs, and track their water consumption and nutrition habits.
